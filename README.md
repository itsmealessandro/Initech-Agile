# Initech-Agile
This is an application made for the course "metodi di sviluppo Agile" of UNIVAQ university.<br>
The app incluse some basic functionalities such as login, registration and profile update.<br>
Then there are other functionalities, a bit more complex like:
<ul>
  <li>Creation, Update and Delete operations on Soci, Maestri and sports facilities, </li>
  <li>Minimal wallet top up</li>
</ul>
There is some testing with JUnit and TestFX, those will run on every push/merge ro check if the system is solid.

This is not a complete application because the goal of the course was to learn the Agile method for developement.
