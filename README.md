# Initech-Agile
This is an application made for the course "metodi di sviluppo Agile" of UNIVAQ university.
The app incluse some basic functionalities such as login, registration and profile update.
Then there are other functionalities, a bit more complex like:
<li>
  <i>Creation, Update and Delete operations on Soci, Maestri and sports facilities, </i>
  <i>Minimal wallet top up</i>
</li>
There is some testing with JUnit and TestFX, those will run on every push/merge ro check if the system is solid.

This is not a complete application because the goal of the course was to learn the Agile method for developement.
